Summary: The Arabian gazelle, scientifically known as Gazella arabica, is an extinct species that once lived in the Arabian Peninsula. These small, swift desert dwellers were known for their agility and adaptability in harsh desert conditions.

1. The Arabian gazelle was a species of gazelle that was native to the Arabian Peninsula. It was particularly found in countries like Saudi Arabia, Oman, Yemen, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates.

2. The Arabian gazelle was considered to be small in size, typically reaching shoulder heights of approximately 60-75 centimeters and weighing between 20-30 kilograms.

3. Known for their agility, Arabian gazelles were swift runners. This speed was a crucial survival trait that helped them escape predators in the desert.

4. They were herbivores, primarily feeding on desert vegetation including grasses, leaves, fruits, and shrubs, demonstrating adaptability to survive in desert environments with scarce vegetation.

5. Arabian gazelles were social animals, typically living in small herds of around 10-20 individuals, although larger groups were sometimes observed.

6. Arabian gazelles are considered extinct. They were last seen in the wild in 1951. The main factors contributing to their extinction were excessive hunting and habitat loss due to human activities.

7. Despite their extinction in the wild, efforts have been made to conserve and reintroduce Arabian gazelles into protected reserves from captive-bred populations. This is part of broader efforts to preserve and reintroduce various gazelle species across the Arabian Peninsula.
