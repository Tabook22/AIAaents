The Arabian gazelle, also known as Gazella arabica, is a species of gazelle known to have lived in the Arabian peninsula. However, it's currently considered extinct, with the last confirmed sighting reported in 1951. 

1. Habitat: The Arabian gazelle was native to the Arabian Peninsula, which includes modern-day countries like Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, and parts of Jordan and Iraq. They were typically found in desert environments and arid regions.

2. Physical Characteristics: Although there is limited information due to its extinct status, the Arabian gazelle was known to be small and slender with a light brown coat. They had long, slender legs and curved, ringed horns.

3. Diet: As with other gazelle species, the Arabian gazelle was a herbivore. It fed on grasses, leaves, and other plant matter.

4. Behaviour: They were known to be agile and fast, often using their speed to escape from predators. They were typically seen in small groups.

5. Predators: The main predators of the Arabian gazelle included large carnivores like cheetahs and leopards, and humans.

6. Conservation Status: The Arabian gazelle is considered extinct. The main reasons for its extinction include overhunting and habitat loss due to human activities.

7. Interesting Fact: Despite being considered extinct, there have been unconfirmed reports of sightings of the Arabian gazelle, sparking hope that some individuals might still exist in the wild. However, none of these have been confirmed by the scientific community.

It's important to note that gazelles play a significant role in their ecosystem by serving as prey for predators and helping in the dispersal of plant seeds through their diet. Their extinction represents a loss in the biodiversity of the Arabian Peninsula.
