## Understanding the Order of Operations: A Step-by-Step Breakdown

When it comes to solving mathematical expressions, following the correct order of operations is crucial. This ensures that everyone arrives at the same answer, regardless of how the expression is written. The standard rule to follow is PEMDAS/BODMAS:

- **P/B**: Parentheses/Brackets
- **E/O**: Exponents/Orders (such as powers and square roots)
- **MD**: Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
- **AS**: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let’s take a closer look at how this rule applies to the given expression:

\[ 20 + 10 - 5 \times 5 \]

### Step 1: Identify Operations
First, we need to identify all the operations in the expression. Here, we see addition (+), subtraction (-), and multiplication (×).

### Step 2: Perform Multiplication
According to PEMDAS/BODMAS, we prioritize multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. Thus, we first perform the multiplication in the expression:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

After performing the multiplication, the expression simplifies to:

\[ 20 + 10 - 25 \]

### Step 3: Perform Addition and Subtraction
Next, we handle addition and subtraction from left to right. 

1. **Addition**: 
   \[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]
   
   Now, the expression is:
   \[ 30 - 25 \]

2. **Subtraction**:
   \[ 30 - 25 = 5 \]

### Final Result
Therefore, the final answer to the expression \( 20 + 10 - 5 \times 5 \) is:

\[ 5 \]

By carefully following the order of operations, we ensure that mathematical expressions are simplified correctly and consistently. This structured approach helps avoid errors and makes complex calculations more manageable. 

Understanding and applying these rules can transform seemingly complicated problems into straightforward solutions, just like we did with this expression.
